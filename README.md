# sample-project-dependency-maven-plugin

This is an example of MAVEN custom plugin.

I spent several hours to make plugin read classes from project where it ran
So this sample will be helpful for those who does not know what to start with.

It's doing nothing so you have to add your logic in plugin class
and change the plugin goal
